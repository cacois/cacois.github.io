I'm Constantine Aaron Cois, a software engineer in Pittsburgh, PA. I have an M.S. and Ph.D. from the [University of Pittsburgh](http://www.pitt.edu), where my research was in algorithms and software development for medical image analysis. I'm currently a Principal Engineer at Dell SecureWorks, developing innovative cybersecurity software solutions. I'm also an adjunct professor at [Carnegie Mellon University](http://www.heinz.cmu.edu/), and a [regular](http://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/strata2013/public/schedule/detail/27350) [speaker](http://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon2014/public/schedule/detail/34064) [at](http://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon2014/public/schedule/detail/34063) [tech](http://devops.com/2015/06/02/devops-connect-secdevops-rsa-the-videos/) [conferences](http://www.slideshare.net/cacois/machine-learningfor-moderndevelopers-35608763).

I'm a polyglot developer, meaning I have no zealotry for any particular language/tool - I prefer to keep myself sharp and adaptable, able to choose the best tools for a given project. This approach keeps me working regularly with a wide variety of technologies, and constantly learning new things. My current projects include some combination of Python/Flask, Redis, MongoDB, MySQL/PostgreSQL, Node.js/Express/Koa, Java, Ruby on Rails, the Android SDK, Docker, and more.

Feel free to reach out, always happy to chat about nerdy things.
