<p>A basic tutorial on the advantages and use of DroidFu. Probably start with BetterAsyncTask.</p>
<p>Start with installing DroidFu. Before we start, we need to make sure Maven is installed on our system, as it will be used to installed DroidFu libraries. Since I am working in OSX, Maven has been preinstalled for me. To check whether it is installed on your machine, try</p>
<pre><code lang="bash">
mvn --version
</code></pre>
<p>This will tell you the version number of the Maven installation, if you have one. If not, follow the instructions <a href="http://maven.apache.org/download.html">here</a> before continuing.</p>
