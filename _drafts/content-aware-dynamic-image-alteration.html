<p><em><a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2swhh_redimensionnement-intelligent-d-ima_news#from=embed" target="_blank">Seam carving</a></em> is a particularly interesting image resizing technique first presented at <a href="http://www.siggraph.org/s2007/">SIGGRAPH 2007</a>. (<a href="http://www.shaiavidan.org/papers/imretFinal.pdf" target="_blank">Original paper</a>, for those interested). The algorithm itself has been covered at length elsewhere, so I'll stick to a brief description: The algorithm finds connected 'seams' of pixels passing through an image that can be removed with the least effect to the integrity of the scene. The author's implementation measured this pixel salience via low gradient magnitude, but other metrics could be used. Repeatedly removing the seam of least salience results in scaling down an image in a given dimension, while applying an inverse process by adding low salience pixel seams (using local mean measures to determine the intensity of the added pixels) can increase the size of an image. The result is a remarkably effective system for seamlessly resizing images on the fly.</p>
<p>In our world of digital renderings and Photoshop, it is becoming harder and harder to trust our eyes when it comes to any recorded image. Technologies such as this are inevitable, and present interesting implications. Web users have become used to the possibility, if not the certainly, that images they view have been slightly tweaked. Colors have been shifted, objects have been removed or added, female forms rarely have any basis in reality, but there was still a base of consistency:  Any image, doctored or not, will look the same (resolution and color notwithstanding) regardless of the device it is viewed on.</p>
<p>With new technologies such as content aware image resizing, this assumption is destroyed, replaced by truly dynamic images. The fabric of reality in images, _all_ images displayed with this technology enabled, becomes a slightly looser weave. Will these images end up looking synthetic to users, through some subtle visual cues, unknowingly processed in our brains? Or will the inability to determine the 'ground truth' of visual scenes beget jaded users, removed from the immersive, encompassing experience offered by the internet. What of the effects of removing the tacit perception of relative positioning of objects?  When onen can no longer determine the relative location, distance, and positioning of objects from one another, does the image lose meaning through the removal of some sort of visual empathy?</p>
<p>The most demonstrated application of this technology has been dynamically resizing images to facilitate elegant web layouts, and while this will certainly be a the earliest popular usage, other fascinating applications may exist. Consider the image as a generic 2-dimensional rectilinear data set, each data point being an intensity value or color vector. What other types of data sets might seam carving techniques be applied to?</p>
