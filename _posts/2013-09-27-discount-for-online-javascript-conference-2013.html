<p>Iâ€™ll be speaking at the Environments for Humans JavaScript Summit on November 21st. The conference is a 3-day, all online conference, which means no travel hassle/cost, and you get to watch great talks from the comfort of home!</p>
<p>It's shaping up to be a great lineup (check out the <a href="http://environmentsforhumans.com/2013/javascript-summit/">list of talks!</a>), and your registration includes copies of slides and access to recordings of talks after the event.</p>
<p>The organizers have given me a discount code to share with you: Use 20COIS to get 20% off individual or meeting room tickets. Enjoy!</p>
