<p>I started a new project I'd like to present. As a programmer I spend a non-trivial amount of  time searching <a href="http://www.stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank">StackOverflow</a> for information and answers to coding questions, as I'm sure most readers of this blog do as well. It's an interesting  site, merging the Q&amp;A model with that of a wiki/crowdsourcing  community, causing it to attract a lot of expertise and become extremely  popular in the software community. They <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/about" target="_blank">explain it</a> better than I do.</p>

<p>For about a year now I've been thinking that this sort of  system could be very powerful as a source of information in other  fields, specifically my native field of computational image analysis. Such a resource would have been invaluable during my graduate  school tenure (community mailing lists and Google can only go so far) for image analysis information, and it also would allow more interaction between experts and others in the community so  that ideas and expertise could be more effectively disseminated. Now with the release of the Stack Exchange Area 51, I have the opportunity to do something about it. I give you:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/17323/medical-image-analysis/17391#17391" target="_blank">Medical Image Analysis Stack Exchange</a></p>
<p>At  this point I like to reach out to anyone in the image analysis community to try to  get people participating in the formation of the site. Its  currently in definition phase, which basically means that users propose  questions and the community votes on whether those questions are on  topic for the site or not, defining the topic scope of the site. From  there, hopefully it continues growing and becomes a useful resource for  researchers, programmers, clinicians, or anyone interested in the topic. With the formation of a solid community, this could be a valuable discussion  hub for students studying image analysis as well.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I urge anyone interested to go sign up and help us get the number of users necessary to take this to the next level. Think of the poor grad students.</p>
