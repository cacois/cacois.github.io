<p>Just a quick note - I am in the process of updating the site based on reader feedback and some layout issues i've been having. The new layout should limit scrolling within code blocks, and hopefully provide a better reader experience. </p>
<p>I'm interested in any feedback readers have on these changes, and thanks for your patience as I worked to fix these issues!</p>
