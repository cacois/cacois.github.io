Its been a while. A long while. 

There's a momentum to writing. You write, you exercise those muscles, and it helps you to write more. Makes it easier to write the next time you sit down. But, just like a muscle, if you let your writing practice attrify, it becomes very hard to sit down and put anything down. Hard to even formulate ideas. So it goes.

This is a trap I fell into, and its time to dig my way out. Just like exercise, good diet, or starting any new habit - the only way to start is to start. Its just that simple and easy and incredibly difficult. So here it is, my public declaration of my attempt to get back to regular posting. I have a lot to say, and like to think I can provide value. Expect to hear more from me soon, and if anyone has questions or things they'd like to hear about, feel free to reach out.
