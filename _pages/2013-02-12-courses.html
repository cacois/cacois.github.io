<p><a href="http://udemy.com/learn-nodejs-by-example/"><strong>Learn Node.js by Example</strong></a></p>
<p>This highly-rated course features detailed screencasts and projects to get you ready to use Node.js in your own projects. I've designed it to be a ground-up, hands-on approach to learning Node.js. I learn best by doing, so the course starts with screencasts where you watch me code my way through detailed examples, followed by exercises allowing you put hand sto keys and expand on my examples to create your own applications. You will come out with a full understanding of Node.js programming, from network applications and chat servers to web applications with Express.js.</p>
