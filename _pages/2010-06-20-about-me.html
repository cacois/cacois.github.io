<p>I'm Constantine Aaron Cois, a software engineer in Pittsburgh, PA. I have an M.S. and Ph.D. from the University of Pittsburgh, where my work was in algorithm and software development for medical image analysis. I'm currently leading a team of software developers for <a href="http://www.cert.org/">CERT</a> at the Carnegie Mellon University <a href="http://www.sei.cmu.edu/">Software Engineering Institute</a>. I'm also an adjunct professor at <a href="http://www.heinz.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University</a></p>
<p>I consider myself a polyglot programmer, working with technologies such as Python, Django, Redis, MongoDB, Node.js, C#, .NET MVC, Java, Ruby on Rails, Android, and more on a regular basis. I'm interested in software development, tech and many other geeky things.</p>
